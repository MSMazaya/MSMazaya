Hi! 

I am a Master of Software Engineering in Embedded Systems student at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a lot of interest in compilers, computer architecture, and embedded systems. I have several experiences: 3 SDE internships and 2 research internships on computer architecture and HPC. I will soon be doing my internship at Qualcomm's Wireless Research and Development team.
