Hi! 

My name is Mazaya, I am an engineering physics student at Bandung Institute of Technology and will soon be pursuing my master of software engineering - embedded systems at Carnegie Mellon University. I have several "working" experiences as follows:

- Research Assistant (Computer architecture and FPGA) @ [Microelectronics Center of Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pmeitb)
- Research Intern (HPC and numerical optimization) @ [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/)
- Google Summer of Code Contributor @ [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/)
- Software Engineer Intern @ [Tokopedia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pt--tokopedia)
- Product Engineer Intern @ [Payable](https://www.linkedin.com/company/payableid/)
- Software Engineer Intern @ [GDP Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gdp-labs?originalSubdomain=id)

Fun facts about me:
- I used to do a lot of web and mobile application development, extensively.
- I was a robotics club member at my university, I was first introduced to utility AI and reinforcement learning there from my senior.
- I became a research assistant in the IC Design lab in my bachelor's university in my last year, I researched custom RISC-V instruction for reinforcement learning accelerator.
- I did a bunch of hackathons, and won 4 of them, those were mostly about web and mobile application development.
- I pretty much self-taught myself about software in my bachelor's degree journey (and I am **very** proud of that!). Though, I must say that several courses from the Engineering Physics department do give me opportunities to tinker around more with software.
- I love physics, though I am not great at it! I enjoyed learning about it and found a lot of fascination with it.
- I am interested in projects or works related to computer architecture, operating systems, and computer networks.
