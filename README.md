Hi! 

My name is Mazaya, I am a master of software engineering - embedded systems student at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a lot of interest in compilers, computer architecture, and embedded systems. I have several experiences: 3 SDE internships and 2 research internships on computer architecture and HPC. I will soon be doing my internship at Qualcomm's Wireless Research and Development team.

I have several projects I am proud of:
1. C0 compiler: an x86 compiler for C0 - subset of C. Written in Rust and supports control flow, function calls, and dynamic memory accesses. All of those feature is implemented to adhere the System V ABI. It's an ongoing project that should be finished before summer 2025.
2. PicoEth: PicoRV32 minimalist SoC design and implementation in Nexys A7 100T with access to UART as its current only I/O. It is projected to be finished before summer 2025 with more peripherals support (DDR3 memory and ethernet).
3. Acme to Alloy compiler: ACME is an ADL developed by CMU ABLE research group. This compiler translate ACME model to Alloy which supports more formal method invariant rules.
4. More to come!
